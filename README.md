The goal for this project is to design a software to model the decay of the He3 spin filter used within various ANSTO neutron scattering machines. This software will be used to estimate the decay of the spin filters, then to alter the data according to the efficiency of the spin filters.

The software is expected to be developed in python, with the capabilities to read both data from .hdf files and .DAT files initially. The code is to be written with thorough commenting throughout, to allow for future adaptations and extensions of the code to be written to allow for further reductions to be developed. The code is also expected to work with multiple neutron scattering machines.

The code is expected to be able to read multiple files, examining the decay in the data and estimating the He3 efficiency. The code will then display the data, as well as saving new forms of the data, allowing scientists to see both the original and updated data files and compare.
